I am currently a second year MS/PhD student in the UMass Amherst [College of Information and Computer Science](https://www.cics.umass.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/) in the [SOLAR Lab](https://solar.cs.umass.edu). 

My research interests include online algorithms, sustainable computing, and multi-agent systems. I am especially motivated to develop theoretical foundations for algorithmic problems at the heart of the green energy transition. 

Before joining UMass, I was a Solutions Developer at [InterSystems Corp](https://www.intersystems.com) in Cambridge, MA. Previously, I completed my BA in Mathematics and Computer Science at Williams College, where I worked with [Samuel McCauley](https://csci.williams.edu/people/faculty/samuel-mccauley/) and [Shikha Singh](https://www.cs.williams.edu/~shikha/).
